				<h3>New unreleased material</h3>
				<p><i>posted: 07/24/2020</i></p>
				<p>Hello fellow Syd Fans! We found a treasure at the bottom of the sea, and it's some really cool stuff. First off, a previously overlooked song titled Someday made by Jonathan from Landscape's album "With a little help from my friends", a beautifully wistful 8 minute song reminiscent of the SWWFO era, a must for any huge Syd Matters fan.

Next up is Live @ OUI FM (2006), a previously unheard of live recording where they had an interview in French book-ended by some nice versions of City Talks and Watcher. We also found an interview in French that completed Live @ Sur Radio Nova. 

All this (and much more) can be found here:
